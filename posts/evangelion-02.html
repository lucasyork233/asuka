            <h1>EVA-02: My Partner</h1>
            <time datetime="2025-12-20">December 20, 2025</time>
            
            <p>EVA-02 is more than just a machine - she's my partner. The crimson armor, the powerful frame, everything about her is perfect. I still remember the first time I saw her, standing tall in the hangar, like a warrior waiting for her pilot.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we achieved a 98.7% sync ratio during training. That's a new personal best, though I won't be satisfied until I break 100%. The technicians were all impressed, but I expected nothing less. After all, I am the best pilot, and EVA-02 is the best Evangelion.</p>
            
            <p>I've been studying the schematics in my free time. The way her systems integrate with my neural patterns is fascinating. The more I understand her, the better we work together. Some of the other pilots don't seem to grasp this connection, especially that idiot Shinji. He treats Unit-01 like it's just another piece of equipment.</p>
            
            <p>Tomorrow, we have a field exercise. I can't wait to show everyone what EVA-02 and I can really do. The simulation data suggests we might be ready for a new combat protocol I've been working on. The scientists think it's too risky, but they don't understand the bond between a pilot and her EVA.</p>
            
            <p>I'll make them all see. I'll be the best, no matter what it takes.</p>
            
            <p>Until next time,<br>Asuka</p>
