            <p>Today I arrived in Tokyo-3 to join NERV. The city is impressive, though I expected nothing less from an organization that needs my skills. The flight from Germany was long, but at least they had decent in-flight entertainment.</p>
            
            <p>I was met at the airport by that woman, Misato Katsuragi. She seems... overly enthusiastic. She insisted on showing me around the city before taking me to my new apartment. I'll admit, the view of the city from the Geofront is impressive, but I didn't come here for the scenery.</p>
            
            <p>The other pilots seem... tolerable. That Ayanami girl is as quiet as they come, and Ikari is just as much of a wimp as I'd heard. I'll make sure they understand who's the best pilot here. My training in Germany wasn't for nothing, after all.</p>
            
            <p>Tomorrow is my first official day at NERV. I can't wait to see what kind of equipment they have here. I've heard good things about their simulator technology. I'll show them what a real pilot can do.</p>
            
            <p>Until next time,<br>Asuka</p>
